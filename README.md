# 🚀 STC Virtual Data Analytics Experience 
# (STC تجربة العمل الافتراضي - تحليل البيانات في)

## 🧠 Experience Overview:

The aim of this program is to create a complete and realistic virtual work experience for individuals who want to explore the nature of work in the field of data analysis at **STC**.

This virtual experience simulates the role of a **data analyst** and **data scientist**, providing hands-on exposure to real-world tasks. Participants will explore how data and storytelling techniques can be used to generate actionable insights and meaningful recommendations.

The program is suitable for **beginners** and **intermediate-level** individuals interested in the data analytics field.
